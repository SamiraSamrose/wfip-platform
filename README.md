# WFIP (Web Feature Intelligence Platform)

**It is a production-ready, full-stack compatibility intelligence system that integrates MDN Baseline data with developer workflows to eliminate web compatibility issues before they reach users. By combining automated code scanning, real-time risk assessment and CI/CD enforcement, WFIP transforms browser compatibility from a reactive debugging problem into a proactive, data-driven development practice reducing compatibility bugs, preventing millions in lost revenue and enabling teams to confidently adopt modern web features while maintaining global accessibility across diverse browser ecosystems.

The platform serves three primary personas:

Engineers: Get real-time compatibility warnings while coding
Product Managers: Visualize technical debt and prioritize remediation
Leadership: Track compliance metrics and demonstrate ROI

By integrating directly into development workflows (linters, transpilers, CI/CD, IDEs), WFIP makes Baseline compatibility data actionable at every stageâ€”from local development through production monitoring.**
